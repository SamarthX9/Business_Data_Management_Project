# Business_Data_Management_Project
This is my Business Data Management (BDM) capstone project titled “Enhancing Profits through Demand Forecasting and Strategic Inventory Management”, completed as part of the IIT Madras BS in Data Science program. The project was conducted with SRJ Enterprises, a stationery shop in New Delhi, using 6 months of real-world primary data (Jan–Jun 2024). The goal was to analyze sales, purchases, inventory levels, and profit margins to uncover operational inefficiencies and provide actionable recommendations. The analysis combined Excel-based inventory modeling with data visualization, and machine learning forecasting techniques, resulting in insights on overstocking, underperforming SKUs, pricing mismatches, and turnover issues. Due to confidentiality, original data has been replaced with anonymized samples in this repository. All reports, presentation slides, and cleaned analysis files are included for reference.


## 📌 Key Contributions

✅ Conducted deep-dive Excel analysis to identify stock, sales, and margin patterns  
✅ Built ML-based forecasting models to align inventory with seasonal demand  
✅ Delivered business insights through visual dashboards and written reports  
✅ Proposed actionable recommendations to reduce overstocking and boost sales
